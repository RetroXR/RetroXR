# §2c — the A/V suite

Moved verbatim out of `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-18; `CLAUDE.md` keeps the summary and links here.

### 2c. The A/V suite — the one thing here that is an actual test suite

`RetroXR/Tests/av_tests.tscn` — 41 cases over what reaches a television's inputs and
what it shows. Headless, ~35 s, **exits non-zero on failure**, so it is the one probe
that can be run as a gate rather than read.

```bash
"$godot" --headless --path RetroXR res://Tests/av_tests.tscn
"$godot" --headless --path RetroXR res://Tests/av_tests.tscn -- --only=display
```

Groups: `routing/` (real TV + VCR + composite leads — cords into the wrong sockets, a
crossed pair, two leads on one deck, a cord pulled), `display/` (which input is shown,
what a blank input paints, a source that stops, a set switched off, snow on an
untuned aerial channel, a VGA monitor with no phono row, a source's own shader
stage, two sets sharing one machine), `guard/` (`can_paint` / `paint_screen` /
`release_screen`) and `audio/` (only the selected input is heard; a machine wired to
nothing is silent). Every case is a bug that shipped at least once.

Three things it took to make routing cases behave, all of them real behaviour rather
than test scaffolding:
- **Pulling a plug needs the whole panel shut.** Dropping one leaves it standing in a
  60 mm grab zone with four video sockets 18 mm apart around it, and the log reads
  `pulled VIDEO on TV` immediately followed by `seated VIDEO on TV`. `_unplug()` shuts
  every RcaPort in the room for the move.
- **And the plug frozen.** A live one falls back down past the panel and is caught by a
  socket on the way, ending up a perfectly good picture cord in the wrong input.
- **The phosphor accumulator hides the source.** With persistence on, the CRT material's
  `source_tex` is the ping-pong buffer, so the oracle is the set's own `_crt_source_tex`.

It is mutation-tested: reverting the deck to reading one cable, disabling the paint
guard, or restoring the frozen-frame bug each fails exactly the cases that name them.
Adding a case that cannot fail is worse than no case, so break the code and watch it go
red before believing a new one.
